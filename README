    Webcomic

    Requires python3 and higher.

    This module checks for new specified comics and loads them.
    Every comic is defined as a new object of the class ComicLoader.

    The class takes two main parameters:

        siteURL : The URL of the webcomic that is going to be loaded.
        pathImgURLexp : The URL regular expression which is used for
                        finding the comic image in the website data.

    These two parameters must be found "by hand", e.g. specified by the user.
    The image URL can be found by inspecting the comics site source code or by
    any other metod of inspecting the url. Some comics have already been included
    in the "mycomics.txt" file.

    The class downloads the data from the site of the comic, finds the image URL
    and compares it to the saved image URL(which is saved in a text file called
    by the webcomic). When they are different that means a new comic has been
    published and opens it.

    Trivial usage:

    comicObjectName = ComicLoader("siteURL", "pathImgURLexp")
    comicObjectName.load()

    e.g.:
    xkcd = ComicLoader("http://xkcd.com/", "http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/\S+\.\w+")
    xkcd.load()

    The function "load" does everything for you. Checks for new comics and loads them.

    The class HTMLCreator takes a list of comics and transforms them into a
    single html document. Each of the separate comics is a separate <div>
    with the class "commic".

        <div class="comic"><img src="<path to image>" /></div>

    To make a personal style, create a file names "webcomic.css" in "~/.webcomic/".

    How to use:
        - create ComicLoader type objects
        - parse them to a HTMLCreator object as a list
        - call freshShaveAndLoad method

    example:

        xkcd            = ComicLoader("http://www.xkcd.com/",              "http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/\S+\.\w+")
        explosm         = ComicLoader("http://www.explosm.net/comics/",    "http://www.explosm.net/db/files/Comics/\S+\.\w+")
        smbc            = ComicLoader("http://www.smbc-comics.com/",       "http://www.smbc-comics.com/comics/\d+\.\w+")

        test = HTMLcreator([xkcd, explosm, smbc])
        test.loadHTML()
