Requires python3.2. 
 
This module checks for new specified comics and loads them.
Every comic is defined as a new object of the class ComicLoader.

The class takes two main parameters:

siteURL : The URL of the webcomic that is going to be loaded.
pathImgURLexp : The URL regular expression of the image of the 
                comic which is used for finding the comic image 
                in the website data.
    
These two parameters must be found "by hand", e.g. specified by the user.
The image URL can be found by inspecting the comics site source code or by
any other metod of inspecting the url. Some comics have already been included 
in the "mycomics.txt" file.

The class downloads the data from the site of the comic, finds the image URL
and compares it to the saved image URL(which is saved in a text file called 
by the webcomic). When they are different that means a new comic has been 
published and opens it.


Trivial usage:
 
comicObjectName = ComicLoader("siteURL", "pathImgURLexp")
comicObjectName.load()

e.g.:
xkcd = ComicLoader("http://xkcd.com/", "http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/\S+\.\w+")
xkcd.load()

The function "load" does everything for you. Checks for new comics and loads them.
Other functions can be also used separately.

To Do/In progress: Multiple class extensions for unique comics.
e.g.: Utility for loading the mouseover text on xkcd.com.
      Overcoming first time opened "Are you 18?" sites.
      Checking for all the comics that have not been read since
      the last read comic.

VERSION: 0.1 - 4th, July 2012.

VERSION: 0.2 - 9th, July 2012.
- fixed problem where it would stop if it couldn't read the sites data
    -> now it skips over that site and moves on
